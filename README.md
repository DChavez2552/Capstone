# NewSpaceTech Project


<h3> 
  <p>Hello. This is a repo of my web application called NewSpaceTech. Its main goal is to provide an easy place to find info on the latest technology under research by NASA.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Currently, it is mostly a front-end application as it takes an api call from NASA and displays the top 10 recently update projects being researched. It is hosted on netlify here: https://60de3242e9fa9100070fbd96--naughty-mcclintock-1ee971.netlify.app/. Some future implementations will inculde an expanded back-end using Mongo-DB (as that is what I am most experienced with), user accounts, a save or favorites option, working search forms, filter options updated and filled links. There are other things I will implement but these are highest in my backlog.

    <strong>A little bit about my coding philosophy:</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>Object Oriented Programming</li>
      <li>Functional Programming</li>
      <li>Be flexible, be adaptable, be Agile</li>
      <li>Communication is an absolute <strong>MUST</strong> when working together on anything</li>
      <li>If I don't know something I will tell you</li>
      <li>When I don't know something I will put my greatest skill to the test, researching</li>
      <li>Bugs are the best teachers</li>
      <li>Take pride and ownership in your work!</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
